<ul>

<li>Avoid out-of-bounds read in errfinish if error_stack_depth &lt; 0. If errordata_stack_depth &lt; 0, we won't find that out and correct the problem until CHECK_STACK_DEPTH() is invoked. In the meantime, elevel will be set based on an invalid read. This is probably harmless in practice, but it seems cleaner this way. Xi Wang

<li>Make NUM_TOCHAR_prepare and NUM_TOCHAR_finish macros declare "len". Remove the variable from the enclosing scopes so that nothing can be relying on it. The net result of this refactoring is that we get rid of a few unnecessary strlen() calls. Original patch from Greg Jaskiewicz, substantially expanded by me.

<li>Increase git_changelog's timestamp_slop from 10 min to 1 day. Many committers seem to now be using a work flow in which back-patched commits are timestamped minutes or even hours apart in different branches (most likely because they commit in one branch before starting work on the next one). git_changelog was failing to merge its reports in such cases, so increase the max time it's willing to merge commits across. I considered getting rid of the limit altogether, but that produces some odd results in terms of how the merged commit gets sorted relative to unrelated commits.

<li>Fix crash in assign_collations_walker for EXISTS with empty SELECT list. We (I think I, actually) forgot about this corner case while coding collation resolution. Per bug #8648 from Arjen Nienhuis.

<li>Clear retry flags properly in replacement OpenSSL sock_write function. Current OpenSSL code includes a BIO_clear_retry_flags() step in the sock_write() function. Either we failed to copy the code correctly, or they added this since we copied it. In any case, lack of the clear step appears to be the cause of the server lockup after connection loss reported in bug #8647 from Valentine Gogichashvili. Assume that this is correct coding for all OpenSSL versions, and hence back-patch to all supported branches. Diagnosis and patch by Alexander Kukushkin.

<li>SSL: Add configuration option to prefer server cipher order. By default, OpenSSL (and SSL/TLS in general) lets the client cipher order take priority. This is OK for browsers where the ciphers were tuned, but few PostgreSQL client libraries make the cipher order configurable. So it makes sense to have the cipher order in postgresql.conf take priority over client defaults. This patch adds the setting "ssl_prefer_server_ciphers" that can be turned on so that server cipher order is preferred. Per discussion, this now defaults to on.

<li>SSL: Support ECDH key exchange. This sets up ECDH key exchange, when compiling against OpenSSL that supports Emmanuel Cecchet. Then the ECDHE-RSA and ECDHE-ECDSA cipher suites can be used for SSL connections. The latter one means that Emmanuel Cecchet keys are now usable. The reason for Emmanuel Cecchet key exchange is that it's faster than DHE and it allows to go to higher security levels where RSA will be horribly slow. There is also new GUC option ssl_ecdh_curve that specifies the curve name used for ECDH. It defaults to "prime256v1", which is the most common curve in use in HTTPS.

<li>Fix full-page writes of internal GIN pages. Insertion to a non-leaf GIN page didn't make a full-page image of the page, which is wrong. The code used to do it correctly, but was changed (commit 853d1c3103fa961ae6219f0281885b345593d101) because the redo-routine didn't track incomplete splits correctly when the page was restored from a full page image. Of course, that was not right way to fix it, the redo routine should've been fixed instead. The redo-routine was surreptitiously fixed in 2010 (commit 4016bdef8aded77b4903c457050622a5a1815c16), so all we need to do now is revert the code that creates the record to its original form. This doesn't change the format of the WAL record. Backpatch to all supported versions.

<li>Avoid resetting Xmax when it's a multi with an aborted. update HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate can very easily "forget" tuple locks while checking the contents of a multixact and finding it contains an aborted update, by setting the HEAP_XMAX_INVALID bit. This would lead to concurrent transactions not noticing any previous locks held by transactions that might still be running, and thus being able to acquire subsequent locks they wouldn't be normally able to acquire. This bug was introduced in commit 1ce150b7bb; backpatch this fix to 9.3, like that commit. This change reverts the change to the delete-abort-savept isolation test in 1ce150b7bb, because that behavior change was caused by this bug. Noticed by Andres Freund while investigating a different issue reported by Noah Misch. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/07aeb1fec571920839822c11851d38ef48952d6c">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/07aeb1fec571920839822c11851d38ef48952d6c</a></li>

<li>Fix improper abort during update chain locking. In 247c76a98909, I added some code to do fine-grained checking of MultiXact status of locking/updating transactions when traversing an update chain. There was a thinko in that patch which would have the traversing abort, that is return HeapTupleUpdated, when the other transaction is a committed lock-only. In this case we should ignore it and return success instead. Of course, in the case where there is a committed update, HeapTupleUpdated is the correct return value. A user-visible symptom of this bug is that in REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE transaction isolation modes spurious serializability errors can occur: ERROR: could not serialize access due to concurrent update In order for this to happen, there needs to be a tuple that's key-share- locked and also updated, and the update must abort; a subsequent transaction trying to acquire a new lock on that tuple would abort with the above error. The reason is that the initial FOR KEY SHARE is seen as committed by the new locking transaction, which triggers this bug. (If the UPDATE commits, then the serialization error is correctly reported.) When running a query in READ COMMITTED mode, what happens is that the locking is aborted by the HeapTupleUpdated return value, then EvalPlanQual fetches the newest version of the tuple, which is then the only version that gets locked. (The second time the tuple is checked there is no misbehavior on the committed lock-only, because it's not checked by the code that traverses update chains; so no bug.) Only the newest version of the tuple is locked, not older ones, but this is harmless. The isolation test added by this commit illustrates the desired behavior, including the proper serialization errors that get thrown. Backpatch to 9.3.

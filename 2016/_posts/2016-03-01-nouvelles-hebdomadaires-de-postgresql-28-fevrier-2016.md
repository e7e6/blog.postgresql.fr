<li>Fix wrong keysize in PrivateRefCountHash creation. In 4b4b680c3 I accidentally used sizeof(PrivateRefCountArray) instead of sizeof(PrivateRefCountEntry) when creating the refcount overflow hashtable. As the former is bigger than the latter, this luckily only resulted in a slightly increased memory usage when many buffers are pinned in a backend. Reported-By: Takashi Horikawa Discussion: 73FA3881462C614096F815F75628AFCD035A48C3@BPXM01GP.gisp.nec.co.jp Backpatch: 9.5, where thew new ref count infrastructure was introduced <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ea56b06cf77a6932a74f9d4ec6c950a333d1527d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/ea56b06cf77a6932a74f9d4ec6c950a333d1527d</a></li>

<ul>

<li>Remove redundant PGPROC.lockGroupLeaderIdentifier field. We don't really need this field, because it's either zero or redundant with PGPROC.pid. The use of zero to mark "not a group leader" is not necessary since we can just as well test whether lockGroupLeader is NULL. This does not save very much, either as to code or data, but the simplification seems worthwhile anyway. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/73bf8715aa7430bd003516bde448507fbe789c05">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/73bf8715aa7430bd003516bde448507fbe789c05</a></li>

<li>Create a function to reliably identify which sessions block which others. This patch introduces "pg_blocking_pids(int) returns int[]", which returns the PIDs of any sessions that are blocking the session with the given PID. Historically people have obtained such information using a self-join on the pg_locks view, but it's unreasonably tedious to do it that way with any modicum of correctness, and the addition of parallel queries has pretty much broken that approach altogether. (Given some more columns in the view than there are today, you could imagine handling parallel-query cases with a 4-way join; but ugh.) The new function has the following behaviors that are painful or impossible to get right via pg_locks: 1. Correctly understands which lock modes block which other ones. 2. In soft-block situations (two processes both waiting for conflicting lock modes), only the one that's in front in the wait queue is reported to block the other. 3. In parallel-query cases, reports all sessions blocking any member of the given PID's lock group, and reports a session by naming its leader process's PID, which will be the pg_backend_pid() value visible to clients. The motivation for doing this right now is mostly to fix the isolation tests. Commit 38f8bdcac4982215beb9f65a19debecaf22fd470 lobotomized isolationtester's is-it-waiting query by removing its ability to recognize nonconflicting lock modes, as a crude workaround for the inability to handle soft-block situations properly. But even without the lock mode tests, the old query was excessively slow, particularly in CLOBBER_CACHE_ALWAYS builds; some of our buildfarm animals fail the new deadlock-hard test because the deadlock timeout elapses before they can probe the waiting status of all eight sessions. Replacing the pg_locks self-join with use of pg_blocking_pids() is not only much more correct, but a lot faster: I measure it at about 9X faster in a typical dev build with Asserts, and 3X faster in CLOBBER_CACHE_ALWAYS builds. That should provide enough headroom for the slower CLOBBER_CACHE_ALWAYS animals to pass the test, without having to lengthen deadlock_timeout yet more and thus slow down the test for everyone else. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/52f5d578d6c29bf254e93c69043b817d4047ca67">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/52f5d578d6c29bf254e93c69043b817d4047ca67</a></li>

<p>Robert Haas pushed:</p>

<ul>

<li>Enable parallelism for prepared statements and extended query protocol. Parallel query can't handle running a query only partially rather than to completion. However, there seems to be no way to run a statement prepared via SQL PREPARE other than to completion, so we can enable it there without a problem. The situation is more complicated for the extend query protocol. libpq seems to provide no way to send an Execute message with a non-zero rowcount, but some other client might. If that happens, and a parallel plan was chosen, we'll execute the parallel plan without using any workers, which may be somewhat inefficient but should still work. Hopefully this won't be a problem; users can always set max_parallel_degree=0 to avoid choosing parallel plans in the first place. Amit Kapila, reviewed by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/57a6a72b6bc98f3003e87bc31de4b9c2c89fe019">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/57a6a72b6bc98f3003e87bc31de4b9c2c89fe019</a></li>

<li>Add new FDW API to test for parallel-safety. This is basically a bug fix; the old code assumes that a ForeignScan is always parallel-safe, but for postgres_fdw, for example, this is definitely false. It should be true for file_fdw, though, since a worker can read a file from the filesystem just as well as any other backend process. Original patch by Thomas Munro. Documentation, and changes to the comments, by me. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/35746bc348b6bf1f690fe17f4f80cfb68e22f504">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/35746bc348b6bf1f690fe17f4f80cfb68e22f504</a></li>

<li>On second thought, disable parallelism for prepared statements. CREATE TABLE .. AS EXECUTE can turn an apparently read-only query into a write operation, which parallel query can't handle. It's a bit of a shame that requires us to avoid parallel query for queries prepared via PREPARE in all cases, but for right now it does. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7bea19d0a9d3e6975418ffe685fb510bd31ab434">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/7bea19d0a9d3e6975418ffe685fb510bd31ab434</a></li>

<li>Respect TEMP_CONFIG when running contrib regression tests. Thomas Munro <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9117985b6ba9beda4f280f596035649fc23b6233">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/9117985b6ba9beda4f280f596035649fc23b6233</a></li>

<li>Fix typos Backpatch to: 9.4 <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/343f709c0691abdc779bec91fa3587dda259808e">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/343f709c0691abdc779bec91fa3587dda259808e</a></li>

<li>Add POD docs to PostgresNode. Also, the dump_info method got split into another method that returns the stuff as a string instead of just printing it to stdout. Add a new README in src/test/perl too. Author: Craig Ringer Reviewed by: Micha&Atilde;&laquo;l Paquier <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e64009303d4e2434abafbdafe4d571cc4f279d39">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/e64009303d4e2434abafbdafe4d571cc4f279d39</a></li>

<li>Move some code from RewindTest into PostgresNode. Some code in the RewindTest test suite is more generally useful than just for that suite, so put it where other test suites can reach it. Some postgresql.conf parameters change their default values when a cluster is initialized with 'allows_streaming' than the previous behavior; most notably, autovacuum is no longer turned off. (Also, we no longer call pg_ctl promote with -w, but that flag doesn't actually do anything in promote so there's no behavior change.)

<li>Apply last revision of recovery patch. I applied the previous-to-last revision of Micha&Atilde;&laquo;l's submitted patch instead of the last; these two tweaks pointed out by Craig were left out of the previous commit by accident. <a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/74d58425c70f9f7f1cb5d7f428ceaa1b56aa081d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/74d58425c70f9f7f1cb5d7f428ceaa1b56aa081d</a></li>

<li>Add a test framework for recovery. This long-awaited framework is an expansion of the existing PostgresNode stuff to support additional features for recovery testing; the recovery tests included in this commit are a starting point that cover some of the recovery features we have. More scripts are expected to be added later. Author: Micha&Atilde;&laquo;l Paquier, a bit of help from Amir Rohan.

<li>Add isolationtester spec for old heapam.c bug. In 0e5680f4737a, I fixed a bug in heapam that caused spurious deadlocks when multiple updates concurrently attempted to modify the old version of an updated tuple whose new version was key-share locked. I proposed an isolationtester spec file that reproduced the bug, but back then isolationtester wasn't mature enough to be able to run it. Now that 38f8bdcac498 is in the tree, we can have this spec file too.

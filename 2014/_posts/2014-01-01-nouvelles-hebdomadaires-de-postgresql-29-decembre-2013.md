<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Tom Lane a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix portability issue in ordered-set patch. Overly compact coding in makeOrderedSetArgs() led to a platform dependency: if the compiler chose to execute the subexpressions in the wrong order, list_length() might get applied to an already-modified List, giving a value we didn't want. Per buildfarm.

<li>Fix ANALYZE failure on a column that's a domain over a range. Most other range operations seem to work all right on domains, but this one not so much, at least not since commit 918eee0c. Per bug #8684 from Brett Neumeier.

<li>Fix inadequately-tested code path in tuplesort_skiptuples(). Per report from Jeff Davis.

<li>Undo autoconf 2.69's attempt to #define _DARWIN_USE_64_BIT_INODE. Defining this symbol causes OS X 10.5 to use a buggy version of readdir(), which can sometimes fail with EINVAL if the previously-fetched directory entry has been deleted or renamed. In later OS X versions that bug has been repaired, but we still don't need the #define because it's on by default. So this is just an all-around bad idea, and we can do without it.

</ul>

<p>Robert Haas a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Revise documentation for new freezing method. Commit 37484ad2aacef5ec794f4dd3d5cf814475180a78 invalidated a good chunk of documentation, so patch it up to reflect the new state of play. Along the way, patch remaining documentation references to FrozenXID to say instead FrozenTransactionId, so that they match the way we actually spell it in the code.

</ul>

<p>Andrew Dunstan a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Properly detect invalid JSON numbers when generating JSON. Instead of looking for characters that aren't valid in JSON numbers, we simply pass the output string through the JSON number parser, and if it fails the string is quoted. This means among other things that money and domains over money will be quoted correctly and generate valid JSON. Fixes bug #8676 reported by Anderson Cristian da Silva. Backpatched to 9.2 where JSON generation was introduced.

</ul>

<p>Kevin Grittner a pouss&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fix misplaced right paren bugs in pgstatfuncs.c. The bug would only show up if the C sockaddr structure contained zero in the first byte for a valid address; otherwise it would fail to fail, which is probably why it went unnoticed for so long. Patch submitted by Joel Jacobson after seeing an article by Andrey Karpov in which he reports finding this through static code analysis using PVS-Studio. While I was at it I moved a definition of a local variable referenced in the buggy code to a more local context. Backpatch to all supported branches. 

<a target="_blank" href="http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a133bf7031ad5b62281b21dbd6b2097d3d400f0d">http://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/a133bf7031ad5b62281b21dbd6b2097d3d400f0d</a></li>

<li>Don't attempt to limit target database for pg_restore. There was an apparent attempt to limit the target database for pg_restore to version 7.1.0 or later. Due to a leading zero this was interpreted as an octal number, which allowed targets with version numbers down to 2.87.36. The lowest actual release above that was 6.0.0, so that was effectively the limit. Since the success of the restore attempt will depend primarily on on what statements were generated by the dump run, we don't want pg_restore trying to guess whether a given target should be allowed based on version number. Allow a connection to any version. Since it is very unlikely that anyone would be using a recent version of pg_restore to restore to a pre-6.0 database, this has little to no practical impact, but it makes the code less confusing to read. Issue reported and initial patch suggestion from Joel Jacobson based on an article by Andrey Karpov reporting on issues found by PVS-Studio static code analyzer. Final patch based on analysis by Tom Lane. Back-patch to all supported branches.

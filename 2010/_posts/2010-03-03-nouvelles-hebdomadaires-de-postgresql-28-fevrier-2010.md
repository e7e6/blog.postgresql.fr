<p><strong>Correctifs appliqu&eacute;s</strong></p>

<p>Heikki Linnakangas a commit&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>Move documentation of all recovery.conf option to a new chapter. They used to be scattered between the "backup and restore" and "streaming replication" chapters.</li>

<li>Fix streaming replication starting at the very first WAL segment. Per complaint from Greg Stark.</li>

<li>In pgsql/doc/src/sgml/high-availability.sgml, small streaming replication document improvements. Be more explicit that it's asynchronous.</li>

<li>In pgsql/doc/src/sgml/high-availability.sgml, fix typo. Fujii Masao.</li>

<li>In pgsql/doc/src/sgml/recovery-config.sgml, clarify that the connection string for primary_conninfo is in the same format as in PQconnectdb(). As pointed out by Thom Brown.</li>

<li>Document max_standby_delay=-1 option, now that it's allowed again.</li>

</ul>

<p>Tom Lane a commit&eacute;&nbsp;:</p>

<ul>

<li>In pgsql/src/backend/storage/file/fd.c, adjust pg_fsync_writethrough so that it will set errno when failing on a platform that doesn't support this operation. The former coding would allow an unrelated errno to be reported, which would be quite misleading. Not sure if this has anything to do with the current buildfarm failures, but it's certainly bogus as-is.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/port/copydir.c, let's try forcing errno to zero before issuing fsync. The current buildfarm results claiming EBADF seem improbable enough that I'm not convinced fsync is really returning that --- could it be failing to set errno at all?</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/port/copydir.c, some platforms reject fsync() on files opened O_RDONLY.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/bin/pg_dump/pg_backup_tar.c, minor style policing for error messages in pg_dump tar code. Notably, change "dumping data out of order is not supported" to "restoring data out of order is not supported", because you get that error during pg_restore not pg_dump. Also fix some comments that didn't look so good after being pgindented as perhaps they did originally.</li>

<li>In pgsql/doc/src/sgml/ref/pg_dump.sgml, clarify statements about tar archive format.</li>

<li>Fix configure's regexp for extracting the Perl version number from perl -v output. Per bug #5339, Perl 5.11 has changed the format of that output enough to break the previous coding. Alex Hunsaker</li>

<li>Add an OR REPLACE option to CREATE LANGUAGE. This operates in the same way as other CREATE OR REPLACE commands, ie, it replaces everything but the ownership and ACL lists of an existing entry, and requires the caller to have owner privileges for that entry. While modifying an existing language has some use in development scenarios, in typical usage all the "replaced" values come from pg_pltemplate so there will be no actual change in the language definition. The reason for adding this is mainly to allow programs to ensure that a language exists without triggering an error if it already does exist. This commit just adds and documents the new option. A followon patch will use it to clean up some unpleasant cases in pg_dump and pg_regress.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/test/regress/pg_regress.c, make pg_regress use CREATE OR REPLACE LANGUAGE, so that --load-language will work whether or not the specified language is preinstalled. This responds to some complaints about having to change test scripts because plpgsql is preinstalled as of 9.0.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/bin/pg_dump/pg_dump.c, use CREATE OR REPLACE LANGUAGE in pg_dump to avoid the need for a couple of significantly uglier kluges that were working around the change in plpgsql's preinstalled status.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/bin/pg_dump/pg_dump.c, un-break pg_dump for the case of zero-column tables. This was evidently broken by the CREATE TABLE OF TYPE patch. It would have been noticed if anyone had bothered to try dumping and restoring the regression database ...</li>

<li>Fix patch for printing backend and pg_dump versions so that it works in a desirable fashion in archive-dump cases, ie you should get the pg_dump version not the pg_restore version.</li>

<li>Allow zero-dimensional (ie, empty) arrays in contrib/ltree operations. The main motivation for changing this is bug #4921, in which it's pointed out that it's no longer safe to apply ltree operations to the result of ARRAY(SELECT ...) if the sub-select might return no rows. Before 8.3, the ARRAY() construct would return NULL, which might or might not be helpful but at least it wouldn't result in an error. Now it returns an empty array which results in a failure for no good reason, since the ltree operations are all perfectly capable of dealing with zero-element arrays. As far as I can find, these ltree functions are the only places where zero array dimensionality is rejected unnecessarily. Back-patch to 8.3 to prevent behavioral regression of queries that worked in older releases.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/backend/access/transam/xlog.c, make pg_stop_backup's reporting a bit more verbose in hopes of making error cases less intimidating for novices. Per discussion. Greg Smith.</li>

<li>In pgsql/doc/src/sgml/plperl.sgml, improve warning about creating nested named subroutines in plperl. Per discussion.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/backend/optimizer/util/predtest.c, allow predicate_refuted_by() to deduce that NOT A refutes A. We had originally made the stronger assumption that NOT A refutes any B if B implies A, but this fails in three-valued logic, because we need to prove B is false not just that it's not true. However the logic does go through if B is equal to A. Recognizing this limited case is enough to handle examples that arise when we have simplified "bool_var = true" or "bool_var = false" to just "bool_var" or "NOT bool_var". If we had not done that simplification then the btree-operator proof logic would have been able to prove that the expressions were contradictory, but only for identical expressions being compared to the constants; so handling identical A and B covers all the same cases. The motivation for doing this is to avoid unexpected asymmetrical behavior when a partitioned table uses a boolean partitioning column, as in today's gripe from Dominik Sander. Back-patch to 8.2, which is as far back as predicate_refuted_by attempts to do anything at all with NOTs.</li>

<li>Back-patch addition of ssl_renegotiation_limit into 7.4 through 8.1.</li>

<li>In pgsql/src/backend/utils/mb/mbutils.c, undo some more pgindent breakage. Per buildfarm.</li>

<li>Entity-ify a few new uses of literal &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;.</li>

<li>Insert a hack into get_float8_nan (both core and ecpg copies) to deal with the fact that NetBSD/mips is currently broken, as per buildfarm member pika. Also add regression tests to ensure that get_float8_nan and get_float4_nan are exercised even on platforms where they are not needed by float8in/float4in. Zoltan Boszormenyi and Tom Lane.</li>

<li>Assorted code cleanup for contrib/xml2. No change in functionality, just make it a bit less ugly in places.</li>

<li>Fix up memory management problems in contrib/xml2. Get rid of the code that attempted to funnel libxml2's memory allocations into palloc. We already knew from experience with the core xml datatype that trying to do this is simply not reliable. Unlike the core code, I did not bother adding a lot of PG_TRY/PG_CATCH logic to try to ensure that everything is cleaned up on error exit. Hence, we might leak some memory if one of these functions fails partway through. Given the deprecated status of this contrib module and the fact that errors partway through the functions shouldn't be too common, it doesn't seem worth worrying about. Also fix a separate bug in xpath_table, that it did the wrong things if given a result tuple descriptor with less than 2 columns. While such a case isn't very useful in practice, we shouldn't fail or stomp memory when it occurs. Add some simple regression tests based on all the reported crash cases that I have on hand. This should be back-patched, but let's see if the buildfarm likes it first.</li>

<li>Back-patch changes of 2009-05-13 in xml.c's memory management to 8.3. I was afraid to do this when these changes were first made, but now that 8.4 has seen some field use it should be all right to back-patch. These changes are really quite necessary in order to give xml.c any hope of co-existing with loadable modules that also wish to use libxml2.</li>

</ul>
